Preparing our dataset\n<p><em>These recommendations are so on point! How does this playlist know me so well?</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_449/img/iphone_music.jpg\" alt=\"Project Image Record\" width=\"600px\"></p>\n<p>Over the past few years, streaming services with huge catalogs have become the primary means through which most people listen to their favorite music. But at the same time, the sheer amount of music on offer can mean users might be a bit overwhelmed when trying to look for newer music that suits their tastes.</p>\n<p>For this reason, streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. One method involves direct analysis of the raw audio information in a given song, scoring the raw data on a variety of metrics. Today, we'll be examining data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. Our goal is to look through this dataset and classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves. In doing so, we will learn how to clean our data, do some exploratory data visualization, and use feature reduction towards the goal of feeding our data through some simple machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and logistic regression.</p>\n<p>To begin with, let's load the metadata about our tracks alongside the track metrics compiled by The Echo Nest. A song is about more than its title, artist, and number of listens. We have another dataset that has musical features of each track such as <code>danceability</code> and <code>acousticness</code> on a scale from -1 to 1. These exist in two different files, which are in different formats - CSV and JSON. While CSV is a popular file format for denoting tabular data, JSON is another common file format in which databases often return the results of a given query.</p>\n<p>Let's start by creating two pandas <code>DataFrames</code> out of these files that we can merge so we have features and labels (often also referred to as <code>X</code> and <code>y</code>) for the classification later on.</p>","cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":7,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true,"tags":["sample_code"]},"source":"import pandas as pd\n\n# Read in track metadata with genre labels\ntracks = pd.read_csv(\"datasets/fma-rock-vs-hiphop.csv\")\n\n# Read in track metrics with the features\nechonest_metrics = pd.read_json(\"datasets/echonest-metrics.json\")\n\nprint(tracks.head())\n\n# Merge the relevant columns of tracks and echonest_metrics\necho_tracks = ...\n\n# Inspect the resultant dataframe\n...","outputs":[{"text":"   track_id  bit_rate  comments        composer         date_created  \\\n0       135    256000         1             NaN  2008-11-26 01:43:26   \n1       136    256000         1             NaN  2008-11-26 01:43:35   \n2       151    192000         0             NaN  2008-11-26 01:44:55   \n3       152    192000         0             NaN  2008-11-26 01:44:58   \n4       153    256000         0  Arc and Sender  2008-11-26 01:45:00   \n\n         date_recorded  duration  favorites genre_top    genres  \\\n0  2008-11-26 00:00:00       837          0      Rock  [45, 58]   \n1  2008-11-26 00:00:00       509          0      Rock  [45, 58]   \n2                  NaN       192          0      Rock      [25]   \n3                  NaN       193          0      Rock      [25]   \n4  2008-11-26 00:00:00       405          5      Rock      [26]   \n\n              ...             information interest  language_code  \\\n0             ...

Train a decision tree to classify genre\n<p>Now we can use the lower dimensional PCA projection of the data to classify songs into genres.

Decision trees are rule-based classifiers that take in features and follow a 'tree structure' of binary decisions to ultimately classify a data point into one of two or more categories. In addition to being easy to both use and interpret, decision trees allow us to visualize the 'logic flowchart' that the model generates from the training data.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a decision tree that demonstrates the process by which an input image (in this case, of a shape) might be classified based on the number of sides it has and whether it is rotated.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_449/img/simple_decision_tree.png\" alt=\"Decision Tree Flow Chart Example\" width=\"350px\"></p>","cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":0,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"dc":{"key":"38"},"trusted":false,"tags":["sample_code"]},"source":"# Import train_test_split function and Decision tree classifier\n# ...
